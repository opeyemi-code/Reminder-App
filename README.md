# Reminder App

The Reminder App is a simple web application built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. It allows users to set, edit, and delete reminders. The app checks for due reminders and displays a modal box when a reminder is due. Additionally, the app plays an alarm to notify users when a reminder is due. Reminders that are due are automatically deleted from the list 30 seconds after being displayed.
